# Ghost stations in Berlin
## An interactive map visualization of the ghost stations of Berlin during the Cold War - Mini Project

Inspiration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_station#Ghost_stations_in_Berlin

TL;DR: As the Berlin wall wasn't adapted to the metro lines' shape, three lines went through East-Germany (East-Berlin), but without stopping, 
making them ghost stations from around 1961 up until November 1989, when the first ghost station reopened.

I visualized these stations by collecting the coordinates of the stations and then plotting them on a [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) interactive map.

The visualization of the stations without names:

I drew the Berin Wall into the map, as Bokeh can't seem to provide an option.

You can clearly see the three lines going through the eastern part.
